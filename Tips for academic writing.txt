Some (incomplete) tips for academic writing:
•	Never use the first-person pronoun or similar (I, we, us, etc.) 
always refer to yourself or other authors in the third person if you absolutely must, but for preference avoid it.

•	Avoid shortenings (we’ve, they’ve, I’d, Didn’t, Hadn’t, etc.) and use the full words.

•	Avoid colloquialisms or everyday words (great, huge, fantastic, terrible, awful)
 and use formal language (very good, large, very promising, disappointing, very disappointing).

•	Avoid figures of speech or slang (“I can’t Adam and Eve it!”, “That was a bit of a Cadbury’s flake”, “Will leave a player Hank Marvin”).

•	Do not make statements you cannot back up, express opinions that you have no justification for or use words you do not understand the meaning of.
